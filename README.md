# ESPhumidity
Humidity logger for Adafruit ESP module pushing to adafruit.io

I wanted to track humidity data an an aircraft engine connected to an RPX Drybot. Adafruit makes great little ESP modules, and sensors already on breakout boards. I threw some of those together, made some 3d printed cases, pushed the data to adafruit.io, and alas.
